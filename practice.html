            <p>The NCAA is a huge world of athletes there are a bunch of talent in the NCAA there are players that are like freak athletes by nature, and some are hardworkers gymrats and they have the mentality like that of kobe and MJ. Me personaly im taking the hardworkers over the natural born athletes.Because the hardworkers mentality are different than the naturals, when things dont go the naturals way they get mad and frustrated unlike the hardworkers.</p>
